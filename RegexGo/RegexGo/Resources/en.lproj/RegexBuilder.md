## 1⃣️ Part Printer🖨️

Tap Printer🖨️ button to see what happened.

The Swift Regex code will execute and print the output to the terminal console.

## 2⃣️ Part Explanation 📖

Just Read the code inside Builder Area. You will find it's very easy to understand.

The full code is surrounded by Regex {}

And there're two parts, the part before the @ and the part after the @.

## 3⃣️ Part Build your own code

1. [Reorder] Long press the text area, drag and drop to reorder the specific line.
2. [Remove] Double tap on text area to remove one line.
3. [Add] To add a new line above a specific line, long-press the blank area to the right of that line to bring up the menu.

❓ What's next

It's very simple, isn't it? Now, unleash your creativity and start building your own code on this page or in playgrounds without the need for a document area(Tap back button). Improve your ability to handle text processing tasks and soar to new heights! 🚀

You can trace the history of Regex back to an American mathematician, Stephen Cole Kleene, who proposed the idea of text representing patterns using mathematical expressions of sorts in 1951. However, his work did not take off until Ken Thompson decided to use it in his editors QED and ED in 1967, running under UNIX, the forerunning of OSX, iOS, and Android.

Although you could argue that the brevity of Regex expressions almost certainly influenced the syntax of one of the most popular programming languages in the world, namely C, which didn’t come out until 1972. A forerunning to Objective C and now Swift.

Although Regex didn’t find its way into the C language, it got incorporated into dozens of UNIX utilities like grep, awk, and vi — and most modern programming languages. So, it is somewhat surprising [at least for me] that it took almost forty years for Apple to adopt Regex in Objective C, waiting until 2010.

And another decade before, they tried to update it in WWDC2022 by re-writing the syntax to make it more user-friendly, including Swift Regex and RegexBuilder.
